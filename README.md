Kami - A List Bot

Coordinate bot for Minecraft(really any game that uses coordinates, but was made with Minecraft in mind) - based off the dictionary data structure built into Python.
The bot was created as a fun side-project(and small GitHub portfolio builder) over the 2021 - 2022 Winter Recess session for the University at Albany. If time permits, the bot will be upgraded. The bot also served as a great way to become more versed in Python.

Important Info

For this bot, the code is completely open source, and can be configured with a user's individual token and guild preferences. Although to work, the bot needs the following permissions;
    - Read Messages/View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Send Messages in Threads(keeps functionality in threads)
Users can perform normal list operations on anything passed into the prompts.
All commands start with a "-".
" -commands " can be used to see a complete command list in any discord channel the bot is connected to.
